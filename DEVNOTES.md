# 🎿 Ski Squad Styler: Our Awesome Ski Prep App

Hey Yoshimi, Seneyuan, and Yiqun! Ready to embark on a cool coding adventure? Let's create the ultimate ski prep app together! 🚀

## 🌟 What's This All About?

We're building a fun app that'll help us (and other ski enthusiasts) get ready for epic ski trips. It's like having a personal stylist and wax expert in your pocket! 

## 🛠 Cool Stuff We'll Build:

1. **Wax Wizard** 🧙‍♂️
   - Tell it where and when you're skiing
   - Get magical wax recommendations

2. **Outfit Oracle** 👚👖
   - Input location, time, and weather deets
   - Receive awesome outfit ideas!

3. **AI Fashion Show** 🤖👗
   - Pick from a bunch of ski clothes
   - Describe your dream outfit
   - Upload a pic and see yourself in the outfit (thanks to some AI magic!)

4. **Memory Lane** 🖼
   - Save your favorite outfits
   - Look back at past recommendations (and laugh at your fashion choices)

5. **Shop-a-lot** 🛍
   - Links to buy the cool stuff we recommend

## 🧰 Our Toolkit:

- Frontend: React.js with Material-UI (because pretty UI matters!)
- Backend: Node.js & Express.js (JavaScript all the way!)
- Database: PostgreSQL with Supabase (fancy, right?)
- Auth: OAuth (so we can remember who's who)
- AI Magic: IMAGDressing (powered by Python, because why not mix it up?)

## 🎉 Why This Will Be Awesome:

1. We'll make something we'd actually use!
2. Play with cool AI stuff (robot fashion designer, anyone?)
3. Flexible coding sessions (because life happens)
4. Learn a bit of everything (full-stack fun!)
5. Agile-ish approach (we're agile, but also chill)

## 🚀 Getting This Party Started:

1. Clone our masterpiece-to-be:
2. Group think on what we want to do and how we want to do it
